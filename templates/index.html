    <h2>
		<p>
			The pictures above result from the forum of the Department for Radiotechnics and Cybernetics, MIPT
			(zlo.rt.mipt.ru, referred to as 'the board' in what follows).
		</p>


		<p>
			Short-term history of the board (a month approximately) was taken to construct a vector model for
			its users, the so called boardtubbies. This model is essentially reproduction of the well-known
			word2vec model from natural language processing, thus we call it here peop2vec (people to vector).
			The shortest way to clarify the relation between word2vec and peop2vec is to  point out the relation
			between constituents of the models: word <--> board user, sentence <--> post (a topic starter with comments),
			text <--> board history.
		</p>

		<p>
			Practical outcome of the model you see in the pictures above. Both pictures represent 2 posts from short
			term board history. The post in red is currently 2 days old (now we are sure that it has collected almost all
			its comments). The post in green is red's closest neighbour in the sense that green and red posts have largest
			number of close inter-user vectors. Thus we think users in the 2 posts possess similar social relationship
			inside each post respectively, and the posts should be similar in a way.
		</p>

		<p>
			The picture is dynamical: when a new 2 days old post arrives, the vector model is rebuilt basing on the new post
			and 2 new  pictures arise. Currently you have to reload the page manually to see fresh picture.
		</p>

		<p>
			Peop2vec was conceived and implemented by Rashid Fakhrtdinov and Vasiliy Pavlov. We're glad
			to receive your comments at mozhno.v.post@gmail.com .
